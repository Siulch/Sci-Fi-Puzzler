# VR Sci FiÂ Puzzler
Puzzler is a project part of the Vr Developer Nanodegree at Udacity, which is to develop a game for mobile devices based on a puzzle, keeping in mind all the experiences the user could have.

This project is about a puzzle based on a Sci Fi environment where the player starts and moves slowly towards the room where the puzzle is. The player has to memorize the sequence of the batteries that were turned on and repeat it by clicking on the batteries in the correct order, if it is correct it can start again.
